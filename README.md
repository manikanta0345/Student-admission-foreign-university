Business Context
•	Students planning to go abroad for higher studies often face difficulty finding the right universities that match their skill set.
•	Visiting multiple consultancies and paying separate admission fees becomes time-consuming and expensive.
•	A data-driven approach can help reduce admission costs by identifying the best universities based on GRE, TOEFL scores, and academic profile.

Business Problem
•	The main objective is to predict the probability of a student getting admission into a foreign university.
•	This helps students apply to universities that align with their profile and avoid unnecessary admission or consultancy fees.

Solution Developed
•	Identified and handled null values and outliers in the dataset.
•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using histograms, boxplots, and count plots to understand the relationship between features.
•	Converted the cleaned data into numerical vectors for machine learning model training.
•	Trained and compared multiple machine learning algorithms.
•	Linear Regression achieved the highest accuracy among all tested models.

Improvements to the Solution
•	Applied hyperparameter tuning, improving model accuracy from 80% to 83%.
•	Optimization helped reduce model bias and improve overall performance.
